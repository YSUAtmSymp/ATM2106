{"pages":[{"url":".","text":"Course Description The atmosphere and ocean control the earth climate system by transporting energy, heat, momentum and gas, as well as exchanging them across two components. Air-sea Interaction (ATM2106) course examines the influence of atmospheric circulation on the ocean, or oceanic circulation on atmosphere, and tries to understand the climate system based on the circulation of two bodies and their interactions. This course covers the circulation and interactions in low/mid/high latitudes and small/large scales. 대기와 해양은 서로 에너지, 열 및 가스를 주고 받으면서 지구 기후시스템을 조정합니다. 대기, 해양 상호작용 (ATM2106)은 대기 순환이 해양에, 혹은 해양 순환이 대기에 어떤 영향을 주는지 알아봄으로서 기후시스템을 보다 포괄적인 관점에서 다루는 과목입니다. 저위도, 중위도, 그리고 고위도 지역에서 일어나는 대기 해양 상호작용을 서술하고 크고 작은 규모의 순환에서 일어나는 대기 해양 상호작용에 대해 토론할 것입니다. Instructor Hajoon Song + Office : + Email : + Telephone : Class Room 523, Science Hall, MW 3:00 pm - 4:55 pm 수강대상 This course may be appropriate for students in the sophomore or junior year who want to gain basic knowledge about the circulation in atmosphere and ocean and the interactions between two bodies. 수업목표 및 개요 Upon the completion of this course, students will grasp the concept of atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the rotating earth, and what are the controlling factors. This descriptive course provides an introduction to upper-level atmospheric classes. 선수과목(선수학습) None 강좌운영방식 Lectures using slides and student projects 성적평가방법 Homework : 30% Midterm : 30% Final : 30% Attendance and participation : 10% 교재 및 참고문헌","tags":"pages","title":""},{"url":"pages/links.html","text":"Links to the models MITgcm ROMS QG model Computing program Python Miniconda Jupyter Notebook Documentation This course is designed to provide students the background of ocean modeling and hands-on learning environment for their own research.
